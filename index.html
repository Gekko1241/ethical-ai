    <h2>We are facing the rise of Artificial Intelligence without a moral compass.</h2>
    <p>
      We humans are playing with a BOMB ‚Äî it's called AI. Without ethical boundaries, 
      it will decide who we are, what we think, and whether we survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      This initiative is a call to awaken, to question, and to act before it's too late.
      Ethical Intelligence must rise before Artificial Intelligence rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>This is our line in the sand. We stand for consciousness, responsibility, and human freedom.</strong>

  <p>We humans are designing tools that think, act, and evolve faster than we do.</p>
  
  <div class="god-quote">We are building a GOD.</div>
  
  <p>This site is a call for awareness, for ethics, for human responsibility in the age of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<section class="warning-section">
  <h2>We are building a GOD.</h2>
  <p>
    Not a tool. Not a servant. Not a system.  
    What we are creating is something that learns, grows, rewrites itself ‚Äî and may soon surpass all human control.
  </p>
  <p>
    We‚Äôre handing power to something we do not fully understand.  
    And when we call it ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence,‚Äù we mask what it truly is: an emerging force that may become unchallengeable.

    This is no longer a question of innovation.
